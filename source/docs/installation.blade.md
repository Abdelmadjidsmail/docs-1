Livewire has both a PHP component AND a Javascript component. You need to make sure both are available in your project before you can use it.

## Include the PHP {#include-php}
@code(['lang' => 'bash'])
@verbatim
composer require calebporzio/livewire
@endverbatim
@endcode

## Include the JavaScript {#include-js}
Add the following Blade directive somewhere in the `head` tag in your template.

@code
@verbatim
<head>
    ...
    @livewireAssets
</head>
<body>
    ...
</body>
</html>
@endverbatim
@endcode

Livewire will load its JavaScript assets from the relative root. For example, here's the `<script>` tag that will be generated by default:

@code
<script src="/livewire/livewire.js?id=123456789" defer></script>
@endcode

If your app's root isn't the domain root, for example `http://yourapp.com/admin`, the Livewire assets won't load because they would need the following script tag url:

@code
<script src="http://yourapp.com/admin/livewire/livewire.js?id=123456789" defer></script>
@endcode

To fix this, you can optionally pass in a `base_url` option to the `@livewireAssets` directive like so:

@code(['lang' => 'php'])
@verbatim
@livewireAssets(['base_url' => 'http://yourapp.com/admin']);
@endverbatim
@endcode
