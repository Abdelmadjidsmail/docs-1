description: 'Let''s get up to speed on the current state of Livewire.'
long_description: "All right. So I started recording another episode and basically ended up just talking about where Livewire is headed and thought, well, why don't I name this properly? So calling this current roadmap, I cut the episode off early and I'm just going to rerecord it. So the. A current roadmap of live wire, so live where I'm just wanting to give you an idea of where things are at in my brain and with the project and whatnot.\r\n\r\nSo I've talked about it at two conferences now, a bunch of meetups. There's a good solid amount of people in the repository submitting issues and some submitting pull requests and moving the project forward. I'm pairing with people. I've had. Uh, I'm going to basically have like five pair programming sessions this week, total one last week where I talk with people about the project, about their issues with it, things.\r\n\r\nAnd these are people who are using it and who are in the repository every day. Um. So that the original episode was called keeping my finger on the pulse, and maybe I'll record another episode talking about that, but for now, I just want to give you the roadmap. So the project's getting more solid.\r\n\r\nWhen I released it at lexicon con, I felt like it was cool. I felt, I felt like the API was there. I felt like I knew, I felt like it was good enough to tag a 1.0 in terms of API. But I didn't feel like it was there under the hood. Um, pretty much the main reason being that it's, it's like 60% JavaScript or 50%.\r\n\r\nI don't know it, it waivers between 40 and 60% of Javas JavaScript, JavaScript core. So the Java script part, that's the tricky part. That's the part that I have to deal with. Browser support, Dom diffing woes. Hear me. Yeah. Um, that's the big one. That's honestly the big one. Um, a lot of that stuff.\r\n\r\nSo making the, making it, you know, it's a pretty ambitious project in terms of implementation. Like I'm just solving whackadoo problems all the time, and I want to make sure that a lot of people have used it and tried it with different things and it works seamlessly. And I'm just now feeling like we're getting to that point.\r\n\r\nI'm just now feeling like I'm starting to see that it seems like there's a lot of issues in the repository, but a lot of them are related and now I can start kind of closing them in bulk. And a lot of them are related to dumb diffing. And as I, as I hardened that core, um, those things, you know, just get addressed as we go.\r\n\r\nSo I'm feeling good about the project. I'm feeling like it's much more dependable that I'm having these conversations with people and they're going, you know, I'm asking you what are the issues you're experiencing. They named one or two that's known or that I already fixed, and then they say, but honestly, that's about it.\r\n\r\nIt really kind of works for me. It just works well. I don't know, and that's really good to hear and I'm hearing that more. More and more. Um, so that's good. Alright. So, and that's the thing I kept telling people and they're like, well, when are you going to tag a release when it and I S or what are your plans?\r\n\r\nAnd I, you know, when I'm standing at the press releases and everybody's, you know, shoving a mic in my face, like, what are your plans with live layer and wait, okay. Um. Yeah. So what am I plans at that time? I said, well, I'm just focused on getting the core heart. And at the moment I'm not gonna do educational materials.\r\n\r\nI'm not gonna do pro subscriptions or anything like that. I'm going to make the core, you know, ma, you probably have heard different things along the way, cause I often do have ambitions, but I've, every time I settle them back and go, no, no, no, just make the core hard, get people using it in production, get a wide user base that's dedicated.\r\n\r\nMake a tool that's very useful and very good, and then all these things will be added unto you. So that has been, that has been my thinking, and I feel like I'm reaching the end of that point. I feel like I'm, I'm not gonna give a timeline, but I feel like we're headed in that direction of me feeling like this is a good tool.\r\n\r\nIt's pretty solid. Now let's start building stuff with it. Let's start teaching people how to build stuff with it. Let's tag a 1.0. Well, let's offer, you know, enterprise support. Let's, let's really make this thing happen. Which is funny because it's, you know, this is like, we're going on 10 months here.\r\n\r\nI'm, this is, I'm in it for the long haul. Like I'm in the long game. And that's something I think about more and more these days is like, that's a lesson I'm sure I've talked about before. Huge lesson I've learned with this tool is like, okay. Um, be in it for the long haul. Like, don't, don't play the short game, play the long game.\r\n\r\nAnd, and, uh, I dunno, I'm calmer about it now. I'm not as worried about another tool coming up that's bigger and better or something. Like I'm just kind of focused on this and making it good over time. Um, and eventually. With enough effort and with enough a heart, I think it will, um, get, get the recognition that get the amount of recognition that it deserves, whatever that is.\r\n\r\nSo, which I hope will be pretty high. So the roadmap ahead of me now, after I start to get some of this stuff on your doubt, which I, like I said, we're getting ironed out. Um, I'm gonna start building stuff. With it. Um, I need to have a project built with it personally before I tag a 1.0 the next big milestone is tagging the 1.0 and there's two things I want to make sure.\r\n\r\nWell, three things that I want to make sure are done before I tag one point. Oh the first thing is I want to, um, I want to have used it in a project myself. The first and biggest thing. So I, I do dummy stuff all the time with it. I use it a lot, but I wanna use it in a real SAS app and I'm sure I'll, you know, leverage that SAS app as like a, maybe a course or just a fruit.\r\n\r\nMaybe I'll pair or I'll stream like me building it or whatever, but, um, I want to build a SAS app with it that's full and functional and I'm sure that I will encounter things that I will modify live wire to meet. But once I have a full SAS app built, that I believe is your average Sassa app. And built and I'm happy with it.\r\n\r\nI will write educational materials. Um, I'll write educational materials. Uh, based off of that. So those are the three things, educational materials, the app. And then the third thing I didn't mention, which is the testing of the app. So I'll use the Livewire testing utilities for the app, but I also want to have a dusk test suite that tests everything in the app.\r\n\r\nAnd this will be a end to end test of Livewire, basically. So I want to use every feature in live wire inside the app. And I want to have a dusk test suite that tests these things. And the reason being is not that I think everybody should be using dusk when they're using live wire, but it's so that I have something for, um, I have something for Livewire that when I go to tag a new release, I can run it against this entire suite in a real app and get green, and then I will feel a hundred percent good that, uh, that it's safe to release.\r\n\r\nSo. Um, so that, that is the plan ahead of me is use it in real stuff and talk about it and make sure it's tested and love it myself in a real application. So then we can tag 1.0 and then we're off to the races and then I'll start the big promotional campaign. Um, I'll go on the road. No, I won't.\r\n\r\nOkay. There you go."
